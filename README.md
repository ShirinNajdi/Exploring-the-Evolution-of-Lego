# Exploring-the-Evolution-of-Lego

This Datacamp project is dedicated to find answers for the following question about Lego: 

1. What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed?

2. In which year was Star Wars NOT the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year)?
